- CSSÂ Media Queries

### What I learned

I have learned with this challenge how to build a responsive product card using HTML and CSS. I have learned how to make your site responsive using CSS Media Queries, I also revise subjects like padding and margin when building the css of the product card.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media (max-width: 640px) {
    img {
      content: url(image-product-mobile.jpg);
      object-fit: cover;
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;
    }

    .product-card {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      border-radius: 6px;
      width: 500px;
      height: auto;
    }

    .product-description {
      width: 90%;
      padding: 3rem;
    }

    h1 {
      font-size: 2.5rem;
      line-height: 40px;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 1rem;
      line-height: 1.7rem;
      font-weight: 500;
    }

    body {
      background-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
      padding: 3rem;
    }
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to study the fundaments of media queries to get more confartable when using it. I also have to improve on how to change image's positions. I will continue to build diferents designs of product cards to improve even more my HTML and CSS skills.
